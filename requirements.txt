# This used to work, but now (2016-03-18) does not:
# --allow-external mysql-connector-python
# mysql-connector-python==2.0.3
#
# Instead visit http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/ and
# download the source code of Connector/Python. I (Terry) am using version
# 2.1.3 which can be obtained directly from
# http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-Python/mysql-connector-python-2.1.3.tar.gz
#
# Then (assuming you get version 2.1.3):
#
#   tar xzf mysql-connector-python-2.1.3.tar.gz
#   cd mysql-connector-python-2.1.3
#   python setup.py install
